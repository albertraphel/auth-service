1. @Entity
Marks this class as a JPA entity, meaning it maps to a database table.

2. @Table(name = "users")
Maps the class to the users table in the database (you could name it anything, but this overrides the default which would be the class name User).

3. Lombok Annotations:
@Data: Generates getters, setters, toString(), equals(), and hashCode().

@NoArgsConstructor: Generates a no-argument constructor (required by JPA).

@AllArgsConstructor: Generates a constructor with all fields.

@Builder: Allows for builder pattern, e.g. User.builder().username("abc").build().

@Id: Primary key of the entity.

@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY): Database will auto-generate the ID (e.g., auto-increment in MySQL/Postgres).

public String generateToken(String username)
This method generates a JWT token for the given username.

It returns a signed JWT as a String, which can be returned to the client (e.g., after login) and used for future authenticated requests.

A JWT token has 3 parts:

Header ‚Äì algorithm & token type

Payload ‚Äì the claims (e.g. username, issued time, expiry)

Signature ‚Äì to verify it hasn't been tampered with

Sets the subject of the token to the username.

The subject is often the unique identifier for the user (e.g. username or user ID).

Sets the "iat" (issued at) claim to the current date/time.

Indicates when the token was created.

Sets the expiration time for the token.

jwtExpiration should be a duration in milliseconds (e.g., 3600000 for 1 hour).

This ensures the token is only valid for a limited time.

.signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.ES512, jwtSecret)
Signs the token using the ES512 algorithm (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).

jwtSecret is the private key or shared secret used for signing.

This ensures the token can't be tampered with and can be verified later.

‚ö†Ô∏è ES512 requires an Elliptic Curve key, not a simple string. If you're using a string as a secret, you'd likely want HS256 (HMAC SHA-256) instead.

.compact();
Finalizes and serializes the JWT to a compact string format: header.payload.signature.

The returned string might look like this:

This token is typically stored on the frontend (e.g., in localStorage or a cookie) and sent with each API request in an Authorization: Bearer <token> header.

In your project, the JwtFilter (a custom Spring Security filter) is executed once for every request before the request reaches your controller‚Äîexcept for the /api/auth/** endpoints, which you've permitted without authentication.

üîÑ When Exactly is JwtFilter Executed?
This is controlled in your SecurityConfig.java file:

java
Copy
Edit
.addFilterBefore(jwtFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
This line tells Spring Security to run your JwtFilter before the built-in UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.

üß† So the flow is:
Client sends a request to a protected API (not /api/auth/**)

JwtFilter is triggered before authentication happens

It checks for the Authorization header with a Bearer token

If token is present and valid:

It loads the user details

Sets authentication into the SecurityContext

The request continues to the controller if authentication is successful

If no token or invalid token, access is denied (403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized)

‚úÖ JwtFilter is NOT triggered for:
Any request that matches this:

java
Copy
Edit
.requestMatchers("/api/auth/**").permitAll()
So /api/auth/register and /api/auth/login go straight to the controller without token validation.


Typical Flow in Microservices
Client hits auth-service at /api/auth/login

auth-service authenticates and returns JWT

Client stores token (e.g., localStorage/cookies)

For other requests (to user-service, post-service, etc.), the token is added to Authorization: Bearer <token>

API Gateway checks token presence and validity using a lightweight JWT verifier (optional)

If valid, forwards to appropriate microservice

‚úÖ Summary
Concern	Responsible Service
User login/registration	auth-service
Token generation	auth-service
Token validation	auth-service and optionally Gateway
Securing other microservices	Each service can validate token or rely on gateway
Let me know if you want help writing a simple gateway-level token filter, or connecting this auth-service to other microservices (like post-service, user-service, etc.).
